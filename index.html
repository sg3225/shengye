<h2>History</h2>
<p>SoHo is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City with 26 blocks and approximately 500 buildings. The area has been encompassing socio-economic, cultural, and architectural developments. As an example of regeneration and gentrification, it is now known as the area clustering art galleries, trendy boutiques and international chain stores. </p>

<h3>Colonial Period to 1660s : Acquired by Nicholas Bayard.</h3>

<p>During the colonial period, the land was part of a grant of farmland given to freed slaves of the Dutch West Indies Company, and the site of the first free Black settlement on Manhattan island. The land was then acquired in the 1660s by Augustine Hermann, and then passed to his brother-in-law, Nicholas Bayard.</p>

<h3>18th Century : People Moved in.</h3>

<p>Collect Pond was drained and Broadway was paved and sidewalks were built. Along the Canal Street, more people began to make their homes there.

<h3>19th Century : Development and Decline.</h3>

<p>By the mid-19th century, the area encompassed commerce and entertainment industry booming. Along the broadway, large marble-skinned commercial establishments began to open, such as Lord & Taylor, Arnold Constable & Company and Tiffany & Company, as well as grand hotels such as the St. Nicholas and the Metropolitan. This change drove out the middle-class, replaced by small manufacturing firms, including cabinet-makers and the lumberyards that supplied them, brass and cooper firms, makers of china and glassware, locksmiths, snuff manufacturers and book publishers.</p>

<p>After the Civil War in the 1880s and 90s, large manufacturers began to move into the area, especially textile firms, and the area became the mercantile and wholesale dry-goods trade center of the city. As the center of the city continued to move uptown, the quality of the area declined.</p>


<h3>20th Century : Known as Industrial Wasteland and Triggered the Interest of Artists.</h3>

<p>The area had become known as Hell's Hundred Acres, an industrial wasteland, full of sweatshops and small factories in the daytime, but empty at night. Until the 1960s, artists began to be interested in the tall ceilings, many windows of the empty manufacturing lofts, and the low price, so that the character of the neighborhood began to change.</p>


<p>As the artist population grew, there is concerns about the occupation of space that did not meet residential building codes. The city abandoned attempts to keep the district as strictly industrial space, and in 1971, the Zoning Resolution was amended to permit Joint Live-Work Quarters for artists, and the M1-5a and M-5b districting was established to permit visual artists.While beginning in the 1980s, the neighborhood began to draw more affluent residents. </p>


<h3>Late 20th Century till Present : Gentrification and Shopping.</h3>

<p>Many residents have lived in the neighborhood for decades, also, many of the artists owned their co-ops, many of the original pioneering artists remained despite the popular misconception that gentrification forced them to flee. In the mid-1990s, most of the galleries moved to Chelsea, but several galleries remain as of 2013, including William Bennett Gallery, Martin Lawrence Galleries, Terrain Gallery, Franklin Bowles Gallery, and Pop International Gallery.</p>

<p>SoHo now became a popular tourist destination for people seeking fashionable clothing and exquisite architecture, and home to some of the most expensive real estate in the country.
